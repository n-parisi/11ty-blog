## Welcome!

My name is Nick and this is my little corner of the internet. I'm a Software Engineer at Capital One and am passionate about my work and all things software development. I also enjoy tinkering with my homelab and doing other sorts of small projects. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/n-parisi) for more.

Sometimes I tinker with hardware too - recently I had fun messing with Arduino, and last year I built a custom split keyboard. I also had a lot of fun modding my Gameboy Advance from childhood with a new shell and backlit screen. I'll write about it on here and share pics some day!

I live in Pennsylvania with my wife Nora and our baby. We enjoy watching lots of movies, stroller rides, and showering our small dog Hector with endless love and affection. I am lucky to have such a wonderful family!

I also love D&D, board and card games, video games, fantasy and sci-fi, and plenty of other nerdy things. I hope to grow this space over time and maybe stumble upon other interesting uses for it. I hope you enjoy your stay!
