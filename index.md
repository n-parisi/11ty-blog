## Welcome!

My name is Nick and this is my little corner of the internet. I'm a Software Engineer at Capital One and am passionate about my work and all things software development. I also enjoy tinkering with my homelab and doing other sorts of small projects. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/n-parisi) for more.

Sometimes I tinker with hardware too - recently I had fun messing with Arduino, and last year I built a custom split keyboard. My latest project was modding my GBA from childhood with a new shell and backlit screen. I'll write about it on here and share pics some day!

I also love D&D, board games, and many other kinds of standard nerd hobbies which may one day show up here. I hope to grow this space over time and maybe stumble upon other interesting uses for it. I hope you enjoy your stay.

Connect with  me via [email](mailto:nickparisi@pm.me)!
